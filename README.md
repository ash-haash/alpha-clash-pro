Alpha Clash Pro! A keyboard game. It's a simple keyboard game where you will be given a random key to press and if you press right you'll earn points. If you press the wrong key you'll lose a life. It will show you your score at the end. I've written all the functions in JavaScript and used Tailwind CSS for the design. HTML for basic structure.
